- make heatmap work
- extract HOG only once and subsample feature vector for each window
- assemble video pipeline
- handle time series data (manually split into training and test)

- try HOG on all channels (especially situation like frame 250)
- verify video dimensions
- dynamic frame window

- cross validation
- predictions = (clf.decision_function(test_features) > your_positive_distance-threshold_of_positivelabel_to_bounary).astype(np.uint8)
- you can set your_positive_distance-threshold_of_positivelabel_to_bounary = 2 for example
- cross image heatmap (running average of 5 images)
- hot subsampling window
